143 wild bears were anesthetized, and their bodies were measured and weighed.  One goal of the study was to make a table (or perhaps a set of tables) for hunters, so they could estimate the weight of a bear based on other measurements.   This would be used because in the forest it is easier to measure the length of a bear, for example, than it is to weigh it. 

This data set was supplied by Gary Alt.  Entertaining references are in Reader's Digest April, 1979, and Sports Afield September, 1981.

The nine variables in the data set are:

    Age 	Bear's age, in months.  Estimated by an expert.
    Month 	Month when the measurement was made. 1 = Jan., 2 = Feb., 12 = Dec.
    Sex 	1 = male, 2 = female
    Headlen 	Length of the head, in inches
    Headwth 	Width of the head, in inches
    Neck 	Girth (distance around) the neck, in inches
    Length 	Body length, in inches
    Chest 	Girth (distance around) the chest, in inches
    Weight 	Weight of the bear, in pounds
